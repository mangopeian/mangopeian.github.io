# Iron Chef Leftover

Ever come home to find your fridge filled with random leftover ingredients, and you have no clue what meal you can make with a bag of hot dogs, coriander, and a half stick of butter? (That is what is currently in my fridge...)

Iron Chef Leftover is here to help you find any recipes available with your current ingredients.
